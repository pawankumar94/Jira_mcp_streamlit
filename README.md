## Screenshots

### Tabbed Interface
The application now features a clean tabbed interface with separate sections for:
1. Chat - Conversational interface for managing tickets
2. Create Ticket - Form-based ticket creation
3. Search Tickets - Advanced search using JQL

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jira account with API access
- MCP server running with Jira tools

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```
   JIRA_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
   JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-jira-api-token
   ```

## Running the Application

Use the start script to launch the application:

```bash
./start_jira_assistant.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check if the MCP package is installed
2. Verify required environment variables
3. Start the MCP server if it's not already running
4. Launch the Streamlit application

## Usage Examples

### Creating Tickets

You can create tickets in two ways:

#### Using the Chat Interface
Type natural language commands like:
- "Create a new task in KAN titled 'Implement user authentication' with description 'We need to add a JWT-based authentication system for user login.'"
- "I need a bug ticket in KAN for 'Fix pagination in user list' describing 'The pagination controls are not working correctly when there are more than 10 users.'"

#### Using the Form Interface
1. Navigate to the "Create Ticket" tab
2. Fill in the required fields (Project Key, Summary, Description)
3. Select the issue type
4. Click "Create Ticket"

### Searching Tickets

You can search tickets in two ways:

#### Using the Chat Interface
Type natural language queries like:
- "Find all open tickets in the KAN project"
- "Show me all high priority bugs"
- "Search for tickets mentioning 'authentication' in the KAN project"

#### Using the Search Interface
1. Navigate to the "Search Tickets" tab
2. Enter a JQL query (examples are provided in the interface)
3. Set the maximum number of results
4. Click "Search"

### Getting Ticket Details

Ask for details about specific tickets:
- "Show details for ticket KAN-123"
- "What's the status of KAN-456?"

## Direct Jira Tool

For command-line operations, use the direct_jira_tool.py script:

```bash
# List available tools
./direct_jira_tool.py list

# Create a ticket
./direct_jira_tool.py create --project KAN --title "Fix login page" --description "The login page has a UI bug in Safari"

# Search for tickets
./direct_jira_tool.py search --query "project = KAN AND status = 'In Progress'"

# Get ticket details
./direct_jira_tool.py get --id KAN-123
```

## Test MCP Client

You can test the connection to the MCP server using the test_mcp_client.py script:

```bash
# Run all tests
python test_mcp_client.py all

# Test connection only
python test_mcp_client.py connect

# Test creating a specific ticket
python test_mcp_client.py test_create --project KAN --title "Test ticket" --description "This is a test"
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Issues

If the MCP server doesn't connect properly:
1. Check if the MCP server path is correct
2. Verify your Jira credentials in the .env file
3. Use the "Restart MCP Server" button in the sidebar
4. Test the connection using `test_mcp_client.py connect`

### Ticket Creation Issues

If you encounter issues with ticket creation:
1. Make sure all required fields are filled in
2. Check that the project key exists and is correctly formatted
3. Verify that your Jira API token has sufficient permissions
4. Look for specific error messages in the response

### Search Issues

If you encounter search issues with error messages like `Error executing tool search_jira_tickets: validation error`:
1. Make sure your JQL query is properly formatted
2. Avoid using complex JQL queries with special characters
3. Try simple queries first like `project = KAN` to test functionality
4. The MCP server currently has a limit of 10 results per search

### Other Issues

- Check the browser console and terminal output for detailed error messages
- Make sure all environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure you have the correct version of the `mcp` package installed (`pip install -U mcp`)
